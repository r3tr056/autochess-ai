#### Phase 4: Deployment and Real-World Testing (12-18 Months)

1. **User Interface Development**:
   - Develop a user-friendly interface for users to play against the AI.
   - Implement visualizations of the decision-making process (e.g., heatmaps,
     move explanations).

2. **Deployment**:
   - Prepare the system for deployment on cloud platforms for real-time
     interactions.
   - Optimize the model for latency and responsiveness during gameplay.
